## Product
SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It allows users to perform algebraic manipulations, solve equations analytically, compute derivatives and integrals symbolically, and work with matrices and probability functions. Its goal is to bring computer algebra functionality to Python in a fully open-source and lightweight package.

## Target User Community
The primary user community includes scientists, engineers, mathmaticians, and students who need exact symbolic calculations instead of numerical approximations. It allows users to access advanced math tools while only requiring simplistic and comprehensible code so that is is accesible to the widest audience. 

## Activity
SymPy is very active, with regular commits, pull requests, and issue discussions. It has thousands of contributors and a well-established release cycle. The repository shows consistent merges, bug fixes, and feature requests, showing an active community of developers.

## Getting Started
SymPy has a [Contributing Guide](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/contributing.html), developer setup instructions, and detailed documentation. Installation is straightforward (`pip install sympy`), and testing is done with Pytest. The documentation is comprehensive and well-structured.

## Welcoming to Newcomers
The project actively uses GitHub tags such as “Easy to Fix” and “Good First Issue.” The documentation explicitly encourages new contributors, and community discussions generally have a helpful tone. There are mailing lists and Gitter/Matrix chat rooms where contributors can ask questions.

## Personal Interest
I chose SymPy because of my interest in mathematics and Python. Contributing here seems both challenging and rewarding. Contributing to SymPy would require me to deepen my understanding of Mathematics and programming. This project aligns with many of the skills I have already been developing for years.

## Skills Match
SymPy is primarily written in **Python**, which strongly matches my existing skills. My understanding of math and algorithms is good, but many of the things I will encounter will be new and require me to do extensive research. My familiarity with the subject will help me with the learning process.
