# 491 Fall Senior Seminar

A senior capstone course. Students identify and begin a year-long project with options including honors and independent research projects or participation in a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) project. Class readings and discussions will focus on social, legal and ethical issues in computing, software engineering topics and contemporary issues in computer science. Written and oral presentation of technical and non-technical content will be required.

Prerequisite: 290 and Senior standing. Offered every fall.

# 492 Spring Senior Seminar

A continuation of the senior capstone course. Students continue the year-long project begun in 491. Class readings and discussions will focus on additional social, legal and ethical issues in computing, software engineering topics and contemporary issues in computer science. Written and oral presentation of technical and non-technical content and a final public presentation of the completed project will be required.

Prerequisite: 491. Offered every spring.

## Candidate Projects

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/)  
  FreeCodeCamp is an open-source platform that provides interactive tutorials and certifications in web development, data science, and programming.  
  This project is suitable for the course because it is a large-scale community-driven educational software with clear opportunities to study web technologies and scalability.

- [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface)  
  Hugging Face develops state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) tools, including the popular Transformers library for machine learning models.  
  This project is highly suitable because showcases of it's AI/ML applications and it's deep exploration into APIs, data pipelines, and applied research.

- [bpython](https://github.com/bpython/bpython)  
  bpython is a lightweight, user-friendly interface for the Python interpreter that adds syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and other quality-of-life features.  
  It seems suitable because it is compact and approachable, while still involving useful concepts in Python tooling and developer experience.

- [EinsteinPy](https://github.com/einsteinpy/einsteinpy)  
  EinsteinPy is a Python library for symbolic and numerical relativity, offering tools to simulate general relativity concepts.  
  This project is very advanced but I would love the challenge and opportunity to explore scientific computing and applied mathematics.

- [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot)  
  Godot is a fully open-source game engine for creating 2D and 3D games, featuring its own scripting language and scene system.  
  This project is very suitable as I can focus on many different parts of Godot such as the game development, real-time graphics, or large-scale C++/GDScript open-source collaboration.

- [Internet Archive](https://github.com/internetarchive)  
  The Internet Archive develops tools and APIs to support digital preservation, archiving, and access to historical data online.  
  This project is suitable due to its real-world impact and broad technical scope, though it may be too large unless I narrow it down to a specific sub-project.

- [ImprovedTube](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube)  
  ImprovedTube is a browser extension that enhances YouTube with customization features like better controls, layouts, and user experience options.  
  This project is suitable because it provides hands-on experience with web extensions, UI/UX improvements, and JavaScript development.

- [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy)  
  SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics, capable of solving algebra, calculus, and equation problems exactly.  
  This project is highly suitable because it is well-documented, widely used, and offers deep insights into mathematical algorithms and Python library design.

- [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)  
  Matplotlib is one of the most widely used Python libraries for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.  
  This project is very suitable for the course since it is stable, has a massive user base, and demonstrates practical software engineering in scientific visualization.

- [Botpress](https://github.com/botpress/botpress)  
  Botpress is an open-source conversational AI platform for building chatbots with modular components and NLP integration.  
  This project is highly suitable because it connects directly to chatbot and AI development, providing practical experience in dialogue systems and full-stack engineering.
