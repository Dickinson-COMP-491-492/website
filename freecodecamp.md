## Product
FreeCodeCamp is an open-source learning platform that provides interactive tutorials, projects, and certifications in programming, web development, and data science. Learners complete coding challenges and build portfolio projects directly in the browser.

## Target User Community
The primary user community is beginners and intermediate programmers who want to gain skills in web development, data science, and related areas. FreeCodeCamp addresses the need for accessible, free, self-paced coding education. It does this by combining tutorials, coding challenges, community forums, and certification programs into a all-in-one platform.

## Activity
The FreeCodeCamp GitHub repository shows active development with thousands of commits, frequent pull requests, and a very large issue tracker. The project has hundreds of contributors and ongoing releases. Community forums and Discord channels also show ongoing engagement.

## Getting Started
FreeCodeCamp provides extensive documentation on contributing, including a [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), setup instructions, and community guidelines. Installation requires Node.js, MongoDB, and a local dev environment. The documentation is fairly detailed, so it may be difficult but doable with dedication.

## Welcoming to Newcomers
The project labels issues with tags like “help wanted” and “good first issue,” making it easier for new contributors to join. The community forums and GitHub issues show a generally supportive and respectful tone. Documentation includes simple and easy to follow guidance for first-time contributors.

## Personal Interest
I chose FreeCodeCamp because it is a resource I used when I was first starting to learn programming. I have completed a few of their certifications, such as the interactive web design and scientific computing with Python. I believe it's an amazing tool for new and old programmers but know it has a lot of room to grow.

## Skills Match
The project primarily uses **JavaScript/Node.js**, **React**, and **MongoDB**. I have worked with Node.js and React a decent bit, but would definitely have to sharpen my knowledge in those areas. MongoDB is something I have no experience with, but I do have a lot of experience with Database programming overall so I think I would be able to pick it up fast.

## Other
FreeCodeCamp has a strong community culture, which is attractive. However, because the project is very large, focusing on smaller sub-issues would be a more manageable entry point.
