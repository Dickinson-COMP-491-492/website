# H/FOSS Project Poster

Posters have become a common mechanism for presenting project results at professional meetings and conferences. This assignment provides experience developing a poster and presenting your work in a less formal small group or one-on-one setting. Students will present their poster at the Science Research Symposium or the [Civic Engagement Symposium](https://www.dickinson.edu/info/20378/civic_engagement/4213/civic_engagement_symposium). The course faculty will work with teams to determine the appropriate venue.

## Poster Abstract Draft

A draft of your team's poster abstract, meeting the requirements for the [Civic Engagement Symposium](https://www.dickinson.edu/info/20378/civic_engagement/4213/civic_engagement_symposium), must be submitted by 8:00am on the due date.

Submit your poster abstract draft as follows:
* One team member must submit the draft to Moodle by 8:00am on the due date.
* All team members must place the draft into a COMP492 folder in their individual WiD repositories on GitHub by 8:00am on the assigned due date.  Use a filename that makes clear that it is the draft abstract for your poster.

## Poster Abstract Final

Following submission of the draft poster abstract some class time will be dedicated to peer reviews and feedback.  Each team will peer review the draft abstracts of two other teams and provide feedback.  Teams will then revise and submit the final drafts of their poster abstracts by 11:59pm on the due date.

Submit your final poster abstract as follows:
