### Discussion Questions

Post to Moodle a response to the _Required_ survey and _at least one_ of the other questions.  You are encouraged to also read and respond to your classmates postings, and to make additional posts adding your own thoughts or raising your own questions for discussion.  Your posts will help shape the discussion that we have during the class period.

**Required:**

1. Complete this [On-line Survey](https://forms.gle/yqVptCkW8MiNCenU9)

**Choose 1 of the questions below and post a response to it:**

1. From your observations or opinions, why do you think piracy has been so prevalent? Can piracy ever be ethical?

2. Some people think that software piracy is a victimless crime, and that it is acceptable to copy the software because they have a right to the information contained in the software. What do you think about the costs and benefits of piracy? Why might it be regarded as victimless?

3. Should companies care about preventing their software from being pirated or preventing potential users from using pirated software? Justify your answer.
