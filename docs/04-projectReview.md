## H/FOSS Project Review

### Introduction

In the H/FOSS Project Exploration assignment you collected basic information about some projects to which you might be interested in contributing. In this assignment you will build on that background by gathering more in depth and detailed information about a few of the projects that you are most interested in. This will include assessing how welcoming a community is to new comers, how responsive they are to questions, how well documented the project is, and thinking about what you'll need to learn to get started. Collecting this additional information will take some time and effort, but it will be very helpful in making a well informed decision in the next activity, which asks you to select the project community with which you will work for the remainder of the year.

### Assignment

Students pursuing a FOSS Project must each complete an H/FOSS Project Review for 2 H/FOSS projects of interest. Students pursuing Honors Projects must each complete the review questions below for 1 H/FOSS project. Ideally, your project reviews will build upon your project explorations. However, they may also be projects that were explored by others (see the Wiki) or they could include a newly discovered project. If you elect to review a project that you did not explore, you will need to complete the [Project Exploration assignment](02-ProjExplore.md) for the new project before continuing with this review.

For each project that you review:

1. Visit the course Wiki on the course Moodle (link on home page).
1. Go to the H/FOSS Projects List page on the Wiki.
1. In the "Project Reviews" section, add a line that links to the project's home page and to the the Wiki page that you created for the project during the project exploration (you will be adding your review to that same Wiki page). The format of the link line should be the same as for the Project Exploration assignment.
1. Add the information described in the *H/FOSS Project Review* section below to your Wiki page for the project.

### H/FOSS Project Review

Your H/FOSS Project Review must contain the information indicated below. Please use headings and bulleted lists corresponding to each section below to make it easy for the instructor (and you) to identify the information.

* **Project Exploration**:

  - This is the information from the [Project Exploration
    assignment](02-ProjExplore.md). It will have been completed
    previously for projects that were explored, but will need to be
    created if a new project is being reviewed.
	 
* **Developer Community Communication**: This section will explore how
  active and responsive the community is. It will give you an idea of
  what it would be like to try to ask questions of the community.
	 
  - **Channels**: What what are the main channels that developers use
    to communicate with each other (IRC/Gitter/Mailing
    List/Forums/etc)? For each channel answer the following questions:

     * **Name/Link**: What is the communication channel? Give a link to
       the main page for the communication channel.

     * **Currency**: When was the most recent information added to the
       channel?

     * **Activity**: How active has the channel been recently
       (e.g. how many messages in the last day? week? month?)

     * **Responsiveness**: Approximately what fraction of requests for
       information/help receive responses?

     * **Response Time**: When a response is received, on average how
       does it take?

     * **Members**: Who are a few of the most communicative project
       members (nicknames or handles are fine)?

     * **Tone**: Describe the tone of the discussion on the channel?

  - **Issue Tracking**: This section will explore how issues are
    reported/tracked/discussed by the community. It will give you an
    idea of what it will be like to work on bugs/features within the
    community.

     * **Name/Link**: What system is used to rack bugs/features? Give
       a link to the main page of the issue tracker.

     * **Volume**: How many open (non-closed) issues are there?

     * **Currency**: When were the most recent 5-10 issues opened?

     * **Activity**: When were the most recent 5-10
       comments/edits/revisions of issues?

     * **Resolution**: When were the most recent 5-10 closed issues
       closed?

  - **Getting Started**: This section will explore what resources are
    available to new developers looking to join the community. It will
    give you an idea of what it might be like if you decide to work on
    this project.
  
     * **Documents**: Identify and give links to any documents
       relevant to newcomers (e.g. getting started, how to contribute,
       newcomer threads, etc.)
	 
     * **Organization**: How well organized is the project? How easy
       was it to find information for newcomers to the project?
	 
     * **Communication**: Find some messages/comments posted by
       newcomers to the project (e.g list serve, tickets comments,
       etc). Have they received responses? Does the tone of
       communications seem welcoming to new developers? Why?
	 
     * **Issues**: Does the issue tracker designate any issues as good
       for new developers? If so... How many are there? How recently
       were they posted? Have comment/questions on them received
       responses from the community?

  - **Planning**: This section will explore how the project is being
    planned. It will give you an idea of how well organized and
    communicated the overall vision for the product is.
  
     * **Documents**: Identify and give links to any project roadmaps,
       project architecture, design documents, or other documents
       outlining future plans.
	 
     * **Currency**: When were these documents produced? When were
       they last updated?
	   
  - **Project Distribution & Maintenance**: This section will explore how users obtain the application, how developers obtain the source code and contribute back to the project. Note: Some project will use multiple sites or migrate from site to site. Be sure you are considering the most current repository. Use information from the code repository to answer the following questions:
  
     * **User Distribution**: How is the code distributed to users of
       the product? Also, give a link to the download site if one
       exists.  Developer Distribution: How is the code distributed to
       developers working on the project (e.g. git/svn/cvs/zip/etc)?
       Also, give a link to the repository where the source code can
       be obtained.

     * **Origins**: When was this code first made available?

     * **Currency**: When was the most recent update made to this
       code?

     * **Activity**: How many updates have been made to this code
       recently (you define recently)?

     * **Locality**: Have recent updates been localized or spread
       widely across the project (you'll need to browse the repository
       to see where changes have been made)?

     * **Documentation**: What resources are there that describe how
       to make contributions to the project (e.g. new documentation?
       bug fixes? ect.)? Give links to any documentation that you can
       find.
	   
 - **Project Statistics**: This section explores the size and rate of
   change of the project and the technologies/languages that are used
   in the project. It will help you assess how possible it will be to
   keep up with the project and what you would need to learn before
   getting started. Use data and information from the project web
   page, repository and from [Open HUB](https://www.openhub.net/) to
   answer the following questions about the project. Be sure to
   explore the links at the bottom of the project's Open Hub page
   under "Code Data" and "SCM Data" and "Community Data".
 
     * **Currency**: How recent is the Open Hub analysis? If the
       project you are reviewing is not in Open Hub or has not been
       updated for over 6 months, submit a request to the Technical
       Issue Help Forum at [Black Duck Open
       Hub](https://community.synopsys.com/s/black-duck-open-hub)
       (this will require you to create a free account). Then wait a
       few days for the data to see if the statistics have updated
       before answering the questions. If the statistics are not
       updated, then you should make a serious effort to
       complement/verify the Open Hub data using the project's own
       website and repository (e.g. GitHub).

     * **Size**: How many lines of code are in the project?

     * **Documentation**: What is the percentage of lines that are
       comments?

     * **Growth**: How would you characterize the growth of the code
       base: decreasing, stable, growing slowly, growing quickly?

     * **Main Language**: What is the main programming language used
       in this project?

     * **Main Language %**: What is the percentage of comment lines in
       this language?

     * **Other Languages**: What other programming languages are used
       by the project?

     * **Technologies**: What other frameworks and/or technologies are
       used in this project? Include testing frameworks as well. You
       will likely need to consult the project web page and repository
       for this information.

     * **People**: How many different people have contributed to this
       project?

     * **Active People**: How many different people have contributed
       to this project in the last year?

     * **Contributors**: Who are the top contributors to the project?
       When was their last commit?

     * **Openness**: Of the newest contributors, how many are new to
       the project (e.g. how many have a small number of commits)?
	   
 - **Assessment**: Give an overall assessment of how you would feel
   about joining this open source project. What gives you confidence
   it would go well? What concerns you?
