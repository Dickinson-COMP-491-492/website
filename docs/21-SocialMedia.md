## Social Media

### Overview

In general, we are thinking of discussing:
* Addiction problems, other mental health issues
* Influence on politics (aka polarization, radicalization)
* Influence on society as a whole (socialization, the popularity of emotionally charged content, etc.)
* Companies/government responsibility
* Banning/deleting misinformation, harmful content, radical groups, and how it is related to freedom of speech
* Limited access to social media to teenagers (China's case)
