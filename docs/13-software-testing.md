  * [Introduction, Basics & Importance](https://www.guru99.com/software-testing-introduction-importance.html)
  * [7 Software Testing Principles](https://www.guru99.com/software-testing-seven-principles.html)

* Some examples - review these. Find one or two and try to connect back to the prior readings.
  * [37 Epic Software Failures that Mandate the Need for Adequate Software Testing](https://www.cigniti.com/blog/37-software-failures-inadequate-software-testing/)
  * [Top Software Failures Due to Lack of Testing](https://www.bugraptors.com/blog/top-software-failures-due-to-lack-of-testing)

* If you are doing an H/FOSS project, research what types of testing are being done in your H/FOSS project and what frameworks are being used to automate it. Be prepared to discuss.

* Post questions for class discussion to the Moodle forum. Please also
  feel free to comment on or respond to others' questions as
  appropriate.

### Supplemental Readings

* [Introduction to Software Engineering/Testing](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Software_Engineering/Testing) - A wiki book that introduces the different types of software testing.

* [Software Testing Overview](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Young30/publication/273319104_Software_Testing_Overview/links/54fe04680cf2741b69ef9a38/Software-Testing-Overview.pdf) - gives some more examples of the different types of testing.

* [Introduction to Software Testing](http://www.cse.hcmut.edu.vn/~hiep/KiemthuPhanmem/Tailieuthamkhao/Introduction%20to%20Software%20Testing.pdf) - a full text dedicated to the subject. Chapter 1 gives a nice introduction and overview, the rest expands on that.  As a text this establishes a more formal foundation.

* [Software Testing Dictionary](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_testing_dictionary/) - A Tutorials Point collection of a massive number of different types of testing with short explanation and examples.

* [Software Errors Cost U.S. Economy $59.5 Billion Annually](http://www.abeacha.com/NIST_press_release_bugs_cost.htm) - A little dated, but still important report from NIST on a study to estimate the economic impact of software flaws and argue for better software testing tools and techniques. Ironically, this page has a bug in its HTML code!
