# Git and GitHub Workflow activity

## Introduction

Many H/FOSS projects use GitHub as the repository for their source
code. This activity is designed to familiarize you with the common
workflow elements for interacting with H/FOSS projects hosted on
GitHub. The activity is divided into four parts:

* [Part 1 - Before the First Class](#part-1-before-the-first-class):
  You will complete this before the first hands-on class period with
  Git/GitHub. It will walk you through the process of configuring Git,
  forking a repository on GitHub, cloning that repository to your
  local machine, and setting up an upstream remote in Git.
* [Part 2 - Hands-On in the First
  Class](#part-2-hands-on-in-the-first-class): You will complete this
  part hands-on during the first class period. It will walk you
  through the process of claiming an issue, creating a working branch,
  fixing the issue, pushing the fix to your GitHub repo, making a pull
  request, and keeping your local and remote repos into synch with
  upstream changes.
* [Part 3 - Before the Second Class](#part-3-before-the-second-class):
  You will complete this part following the first class period and
  before the second. In it you will repeat the process of claiming an
  issue, creating a branch, making a fix, pushing the fix to your
  GitHub repo and making a pull request.
* [Part 4 - Hands-On in the Second Class](#part-4-hands-on-in-the-second-class): You will complete this part
  hands-on during the second class period. It will walk you through
  the process of resolving conflicts with concurrent upstream
  changes. You will synchronize your repos with the upstream, use a
  graphical merge tool to resolve conflicts and update your pull
  request before finally resynchronizing your repo with the upstream
  one final time.
