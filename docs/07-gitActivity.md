# Git and GitHub Workflow activity

[under construction]

## Introduction

Many H/FOSS projects use GitHub as the repository for their source
code. This activity is designed to familiarize you with the common
workflow elements for interacting with H/FOSS projects hosted on
GitHub. The activity is divided into four parts:

* Part 1 - Before the First Class: You will complete this before the
  first hands-on class period with Git/GitHub. It will walk you
  through the process of configuring Git, forking a repository on
  GitHub, cloning that repository to your local machine, and setting
  up an upstream remote in Git.
* Part 2 - Hands-On in the First Class: You will complete this part
  hands-on during the first class period. It will walk you through the
  process of claiming an issue, creating a working branch, fixing the
  issue, pushing the fix to your GitHub repo, making a pull request,
  and keeping your local and remote repos into synch with upstream
  changes.
* Part 3 - Before the Second Class: You will complete this part
  following the first class period and before the second. In it you
  will repeat the process of claiming an issue, creating a branch,
  making a fix, pushing the fix to your GitHub repo and making a pull
  request.
* Part 4 - Hands-On in the Second Class: You will complete this part
  hands-on during the second class period. It will walk you through
  the process of resolving conflicts with concurrent upstream
  changes. You will synchronize your repos with the upstream, use a
  graphical merge tool to resolve conflicts and update your pull
  request before finally resynchronizing your repo with the upstream
  one final time.
  
## Prerequisites:

* A basic familiarity with Git is helpful before beginning this
activity. The following sites provide good starting points:
  - [Learn Git Branching: Introduction Sequence
(1-4)](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) 
  - [Video Introduction to Git](https://git-scm.com/videos)
* You should have already completed the Software Installation
  activity. All work for this Git/GitHub Workflow activity should be
  completed in the Ubuntu install from the Software Installation
  activity.
* In addition, you should have received and accepted the e-mail
  invitation from GitHub "to collaborate on the
  `github-issues-activity` repository."

## General Information:

In the following text, commands to be typed at the terminal are shown
in mono-spaced type `like this` and any parts of those commands that
you will need to customize for yourself are shown in angle brackets
`<*like this*>`. The angle brackets are not part of the command and
should be omitted when you fill in the appropriate values.

Each time you reach a *Checkpoint*, please stop and wait. These are
points at which we will discuss subtleties of the operations and
ensure that the class is progressing together. If you reach a
checkpoint before other groups, check to see if you might be able to
provide assistance.

The [slides used during the activity](07-githubslides.pdf) are
available for later reference. The titles of the slides illustrating
each task correspond to underlined sub-section names below.

A [GitHub cheatsheet](07-github-cheatsheet.md) with a short summary of each of the sets of commands that we use for particular tasks is also available.
