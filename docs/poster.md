# H/FOSS Project Poster

Posters have become a common mechanism for presenting project results at professional meetings and conferences. This assignment provides experience developing a poster and presenting your work in a less formal small group or one-on-one setting. Students will present their poster at the Science Research Symposium or the [Civic Engagement Symposium](https://www.dickinson.edu/info/20378/civic_engagement/4213/civic_engagement_symposium). The course faculty will work with teams to determine the appropriate venue.

## Poster Abstract Draft

A draft of your team's poster abstract, meeting the requirements for the [Civic Engagement Symposium](https://www.dickinson.edu/info/20378/civic_engagement/4213/civic_engagement_symposium), must be submitted by 8:00am on the due date.

Submit your poster abstract draft as follows:
* One team member must submit the draft to Moodle by 8:00am on the due date.
* All team members must place the draft into a COMP492 folder in their individual WiD repositories on GitHub by 8:00am on the assigned due date.  Use a filename that makes clear that it is the draft abstract for your poster.

## Poster Abstract Final
