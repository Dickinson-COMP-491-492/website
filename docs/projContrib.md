# Project Contribution Activity

## Introduction
In completing each of the prior activities ([User Install](projUserInstall.md), [Developer Install](projDevInstall.md), [Bug Gardening](projBugGardening.md), [Bug Fix](projBugFix.md)) you have become increasingly familiar with your project and more deeply involved with the community. Now it's time to figure out what else you can do to contribute to your project.

## Assignment

For this activity each team or sub-team will identify a new contribution (or contributions) to be made to the project. Your contribution can be anything of interest to you that will also be of demonstrable value to the project. So contributions could be documentation, testing, bug fixes, enhancements, pretty much anything that, again, has demonstrable value to the community. This value can be demonstrated in a variety of ways. Your prior communications with the project may have already identified something of value that you wish to work on. Those conversations can demonstrate value. You might comb through the bug tracker looking for additional bugs to fix or features to add. The presence of these items in the issue tracker demonstrates value. If you go this route it may also be beneficial to consider several items and initiate a conversation with the community about which would be most useful and appropriate for the time you have available and your level of experience. Regular conversations with your course faculty about the direction you are heading can also be of value. Sub-teams are expected to work on this activity for the remainder of the semester. Note that work on this activity may also require side tracks to learn more about the project, to complete additional tutorials, to discuss the issue with the community, etc.

## Deliverables

Track and document what you do using your sub-team's Slack live-log. Work on the activities will be assessed via the Project Checkpoints as described in the [Course Syllabus](syllabus.md). When your sub-team believes it has satisfied the Completion Criteria, schedule an appointment with the course faculty for review.


In addition, specific deliverables for this activity will be collectively produced by the project team and posted to the team Wiki page. Create a link for a new Wiki page for Project Contributions and add it to your team's Wiki page. The project sub-teams will be adding to this Wiki page throughout this activity. It is the full team's responsibility to keep this new Wiki page well organized and nicely formatted.

The Project Contribution Wiki page must include the following information for each contribution on which the team works:
- __Contribution:__ A short description of the contribution along with evidence of its value to the community with links if possible (e.g. forum posts, issues in the tracker, etc.)
- __Interactions:__ Short descriptions of the interactions that the team has had with the community around this contributions with links if possible (e.g. forum posts, issue comments, etc).
- __Contributions:__ Short descriptions of the contributions that the team has made to the project while working on this item with links if possible (e.g. documents, pull requests, etc).
- __State:__ The current state of this contribution (In progress, Completed, Abandoned). If a contribution is abandoned an additional explanation should be given for why it was abandoned.
