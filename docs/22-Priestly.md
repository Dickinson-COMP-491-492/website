Your posts will help shape the discussion that we have during the class period.

1. What did you find most interesting from the readings on Louis' work? Why?

2. Give at least one question that you would like to ask Louis.  Briefly explain why you want to ask that question.

3. If you did additional reading or research on your own, did you find any sources or information that you would like to share with the class?
