# Project Selection Presentations

## Introduction:

Now that you have selected your projects, it is time to tell the class about them. There will be one presentation for each H/FOSS Project and one presentation for each Honors Project. Each presentation will have at most 20 minutes. Please target 13-15 minutes for the presentation, which will leave 5-8 minutes for follow-up questions from the class. The content to be included in each type of presentation is outlined below.

## Assignment:

### H/FOSS Projects:

Your presentation should clearly communicate the following:

* Which H/FOSS project you are working on.
* The members of your team.
* The purpose of the project. Consider questions such as: What is the product? Why did they make it? Who uses it? What have they used it for?
* Why you chose the project. In doing so you should consider the process you've used and what you've learned along the way.
* The key communication channels for the purposes of each and show that you have subscribed/tried/connected on each of them (as appropriate for the project community norms).
* Some commentary on the available resources for getting started on the project.
* The significant challenges you anticipate facing in working on the project.

The grading criterion for the H/FOSS Project Presentations is included in the Project Selection rubric on the [Course Syllabus](syllabus.md).

### Honors Projects:

Honors project presentations should present the content contained in the Formal Research Proposal. This should include:

* The project title.
* A statement and explanation of the research question being addressed. This must be at a level appropriate to the audience.
* A discussion of why the research question is of interest. This should be supported with context from the relevant literature.
* A proposed plan for how you will address the research question.
* A discussion of your progress thus far, if appropriate.
* A discussion of the particular challenges or concerns that can be foreseen at this time.

Honors students must also submit a printed copy of their revised Formal Research Proposal. The revised proposal should integrate feedback received from the Department or from your research advisor in response to your original Formal Research Proposal.

The grading criterion for the Formal Research Proposal and the Honors Project Presentation is included in the Research Proposal rubric on the [Course Syllabus](syllabus.md).
