## Privacy By Design

### Overview

In this class we will play the [Privacy by Design game](https://evidlab.umd.edu/privacy-by-design-the-game/) to get a hands on feel for some situations in which ethical decision making occurs in computing. You'll play in small groups and then we'll have a short report out about the experience at the end.  The instructor will provide all of the materials necessary for game play.  The experience will help to motivate next weeks look at more formal frameworks for ethical reasoning.

### Discussion Questions

Post to Moodle a response to _at least one_ of the following questions.  You are encouraged to also read and respond to your classmates postings, and to make additional posts adding your own thoughts or raising your own questions for discussion.  Your posts will help shape the discussion that we have during the class period.

1. The Rules document for the Privacy by Design game describes the Healthably Software Company and their GlucoMon application.  Based on the descriptions given invent and describe an ethical decision that you think might be faced by the GlucoMon development team. Then give your current thoughts on how you would make the decision you identified and why.

1. The Rules document for the Privacy by Design game defines three roles. Each of these roles has different responsibilities and thus will need to value different things.  Describe the roles and a way in which the responsibilities and values of the different roles might come into conflict with each other and thus require tradeoffs between their values.  Then give your current thoughts on how you would make the tradeoff that you identified and why.
