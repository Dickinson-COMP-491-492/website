# RD16 - Professional Ethics

## Preparation

Review the expectations for preparation for the [Readings and Class Discussions](./RD-ReadingsAndDiscussion.md).

## Assigned Readings

1. Read Part 8 (pg. 32) in "[An Introduction to Software Engineering Ethics](https://www.scu.edu/media/ethics-center/technology-ethics/Students.pdf)" by Shannon Vallor and Arvind Narayanan for the [Markkula Center for Applied Ethics](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/) at Santa Clara University.
2. Read the [ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics).
3. Select two case studies from the [Using the Code: Case Studies](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics/case-studies) page. Read the case study and the following analysis of the scenario which illustrates how the ACM Code of Ethics applies.
4. Identify 2 to 4 clauses from the ACM Code of Ethics about which you have a question about its meaning, about how it was used in one of the case studies, or a concern about implementing it in real life. Write out your answers to this question and submit as a PDF via Teams.

## Discussion Questions

1. In class we will discuss as a group the questions you have about the ACM Code of Ethics and its application.
2. Then you will work in small groups to apply ACM Code of Ethics to the analysis of one or two additional case studies that will be provided in class.
