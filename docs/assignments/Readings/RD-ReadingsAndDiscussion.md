## RD: Readings and Class Discussions

Readings and class discussions are an important part of the senior seminar.  They are intended to provide you with exposure to, and the chance to discuss, topics in software engineering (concentrated in 491/fall) and timely computing related unsettled social, legal and ethical issues (concentrated in 492/spring). Our coverage of software engineering topics complements provides exposure to concepts and processes that you should be aware of but that are not covered elsewhere in the curriculum.  The coverage of computing related unsettled social, legal and ethical issues provides you with the opportunity to examine multiple perspectives on todays complex issues, form opinions, discuss them and write about them.

The main course schedule will provide links to all of the readings for the class discussions.  Note that readings will be added as the course progresses but will always appear at least one class meeting prior to the discussion day.

Our readings on Software Engineering topics will be drawn from the book [Cooperative Software Development](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/) by [Amy J. Ko](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/). Additional readings drawn from a variety of sources and will be linked in the schedule below.

### Discussions

Discussions provide an opportunity for you to refine your understanding of the topic by listening to others and responding to them, and by expressing your thoughts and hearing others responses to them.  We will at times discuss issues that are sensitive, contentious, current and unsettled. Some individuals may have strong opinions or beliefs about these issues, while others may still be shaping their understanding and forming their opinions. The best discussions occur when everyone feels free to raise points, ask questions and try out new ideas. Creating a space where that can happen requires that we approach all discussions with a generous mindset, assuming that everyone is always speaking with the best intentions of exploring ideas and learning. It is acceptable to respectfully challenge a thought, idea or view that is expressed, but personal attacks against the person expressing them will not be tolerated. Any explicitly disrespectful, offensive, or hateful speech is not welcome and will be referred to the [Dickinson Bias Education and Response Team (BERT)](https://www.dickinson.edu/info/20050/diversity_and_inclusion/3406/bias_education_and_response_team).

### Preparation

**By class time on the discussion date** you must:

1. Complete the assigned readings. 
2. Prepare a page of notes to aid your participation in the discussion.
   - These notes should address the posted discussion questions and summarize the points that you would like to make related to those questions.
   - Unless otherwise specified, no electronic devices will be permitted during the discussions.

### Scores

Scores for class discussion will be assigned as follows:

Score | Criteria
------|----------
3     | Clearly well prepared. Multiple insightful, on-topic, contributions to discussion.
2     | Nominal Score (neither 3 nor 1).
1     | Present and attentive, but did not contribute to discussion.
0     | Unexcused absence.

If you receive a score of 1 and feel you did not have the opportunity to contribute to a level reflective of your preparation you may provide the instructor with your notes for the discussion. If those notes reflect careful preparation and thought the score will be raised to 2.

### Resources

- If you find class participation challenging, The following resources have some good advice on increasing or improving class participation:
     - [Ways to Improve Your Class Participation Experience](https://studylib.net/doc/18188459/ways-to-improve-your-class-participation-experience--sugg...): A short list of suggestions from Students from the Bureau of Study Counsel in the Center for Academic and Personal Development at Harvard University.- [Class Participation: More Than Just Raising Your Hand](https://www.millersville.edu/gened/files/pdfs-faculty-handbook/class-participation-tutorial.pdf): A longer tutorial that may help you assess strengths and weaknesses and formulate a plan for improving your class participation.
     - Talk with your instructor about strategies that can be used specifically in this course.
