# RD06 - Requirements, Architectures & Specifications

## Preparation

Review the expectations for preparation for the [Readings and Class Discussions](./RD-ReadingsAndDiscussion.md).

## Assigned Readings

- _Chapter 6: Requirements_ in [Collaborative Software Development](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/) by Amy Ko.
- _Chapter 7: Architecture_ in [Collaborative Software Development](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/) by Amy Ko.
- _Chapter 8: Specifications_ in [Collaborative Software Development](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/) by Amy Ko.

## Discussion Questions

1. What are _requirements_, _architecture_, _specifications_? What are the differences between them? How do they relate to each other?
2. What makes a set of requirements good? What does it mean for requirements to be legal, ethical and just? How might those create tension with other goals?
3. Why is architecture important? Which architectures you have seen/used? Which architectures seem to be used in your projects?
4. What are _refactoring_, _information hiding_, _encapsulation_, _static/dynamic typing_, _cowboy coding_, _formal specifications_?
5. Prepare at least one question of your own related to the readings that you would like to raise for class discussion. This may be a question:
   - seeking factual clarification of something in the readings.
   - that you would like to hear your classmates thoughts and opinions on.
