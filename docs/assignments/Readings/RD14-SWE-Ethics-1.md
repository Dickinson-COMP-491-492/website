# RD14 - Software Engineering Ethics 1

## Preparation

Review the expectations for preparation for the [Readings and Class Discussions](./RD-ReadingsAndDiscussion.md).

## Assigned Readings

1. Download "[An Introduction to Software Engineering Ethics](https://www.scu.edu/media/ethics-center/technology-ethics/Students.pdf)" by Shannon Vallor and Arvind Narayanan for the [Markkula Center for Applied Ethics](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/) at Santa Clara University.
   1. Read Parts 1-3 (pp. 1-15).
      - As you complete the reading, fill in answers to the questions within Parts 1-3 the PDF.
   2. Save your answers to the PDF.
   3. Send your PDF to me in a private Teams message.
2. Read the LifeDesign case study on pages 50-51.

## Discussion Questions

1. In class we will discuss the following questions based on Case Studies 1-3 as a group:
   1. What are some of the types of harms the public can suffer as result of Software Engineering work?
   2. What are some of the ethical failings by the software engineers at Errand Whiz that led to decisions that created harms?
   3. What decisions could the software engineers at Errand Whiz have made to prevent the harms?
   4. How can software engineers contribute to “the good life” for others?
   5. Who are the stake holders in Case Study 3 and what do they have at stake (i.e. what harms might they experience or what good might they not experience?)
2. Then you will work in small groups to apply the ideas from the reading and associated questions to the analysis of the LifeDesign case study.
