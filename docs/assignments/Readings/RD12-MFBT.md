## Optional Readings

We did not get to the last few chapters of Ko's Cooperative Software Development text.  They complete the view of the full software development lifecycle presented by the text and are worth reading.

- _Chapter 11: Verification_ in [Cooperative Software Development](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/) by Amy Ko.
- _Chapter 12: Monitoring_ in [Cooperative Software Development](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/) by Amy Ko.
- _Chapter 13: Evolution_ in [Cooperative Software Development](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/) by Amy Ko.

## Discussion Questions

1. The author declares (in the introduction) that "the 'move fast and break things' era is over. 'Minimum viable products' must be replaced by 'minimum virtuous products.'"
   - What is the difference between a “minimum viable product” and a “minimum virtuous product”?
   - What products do you think are currently being managed particularly virtuously? or not?
   - This was written in 2019. Has there been any shift in this direction? Why or why not?
2. The author argues (in 4) that the "winner-take-all" mindset of venture capital is "increasingly untenable".
   - Why does he think that?
   - This was written in 2019. Has there been any shift in this direction? Why or why not?
3. The author asserts (in 5) that "it is inevitable that AI will be forced to collect, log and use data in a wholly transparent manner."
   - What is the underlying basis for this assertion?
   - This was written in 2019. Has there been any shift in this direction? Why or why not?
4. The author states (in 6) that data monopolies, such as Amazon, Google and Facebook, "have a responsibility to not only promote fair pricing, but to help support a vibrant innovation economy. The only alternative to such an approach is the near inevitability of restrictive regulation."
   - Why is the alternative to supporting a "vibrant innovation economy" "restrictive regulation"?
   - This was written in 2019. Do these companies support vibrant innovation economies or are they facing restrictive regulation?
5. If companies with a female founder perform 63% better than one with an all-male founding team, why did 79% of all funding go to companies with all male founding teams?
6. Prepare at least one question of your own related to the readings that you would like to raise for class discussion. This may be a question:
   - seeking factual clarification of something in the readings.
   - that you would like to hear your classmates thoughts and opinions on.
