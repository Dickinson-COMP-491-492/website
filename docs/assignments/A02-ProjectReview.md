## H/FOSS Project Review

### Introduction

In the H/FOSS Project Exploration assignment you collected basic information about some projects to which you might be interested in contributing. In this assignment you will build on that background by gathering more in depth and detailed information about a few of the projects that you are most interested in. This will include assessing how welcoming a community is to new comers, how responsive they are to questions, how well documented and organized the project is, and thinking about what you'll need to learn to get started. Collecting this additional information will take some time and effort, but it will be very helpful in making a well informed decision in the next activity, which asks you (and your teammates) to select the project community with which you will work for the remainder of the year.  You should anticipate spending ~3 hours on each Project Review.

### Assignment

Students pursuing a FOSS Project must complete an H/FOSS Project Review for 2 H/FOSS projects of interest. Students pursuing Honors Projects must complete the an H/FOSS Review for 1 H/FOSS project. Ideally, your project reviews will build upon your project explorations. However, they may also be projects that were explored by others (see the Wiki) or they could include a newly discovered project. If you elect to review a project that you did not explore, you will need to complete a [Project Exploration](A02-ProjectExploration.md) for the new project before completing a Project Review for it.

For each project that you review:

1. Visit the course Wiki on the course Moodle (link on home page).
2. Go to the H/FOSS Projects List page on the Wiki.
3. Under the "Project Review" heading, add a line for the project you are exploring, or add to the line if there is already one, there should only be one line per project. Link to the same Wiki page that you created for the Project Exploration, you will add your review to the bottom of that page.  **Also, please keep the projects listed in alphabetical order.** The format of the link line should be the same as for the Project Exploration assignment.
4. Add the information described in the *H/FOSS Project Review* section below at the bottom of the Wiki page you created for the Project Exploration.

### H/FOSS Project Review

Your H/FOSS Project Review must contain the information indicated below. Please use headings and bulleted lists corresponding to each section below to make it easy for the instructor (and you) to identify the information.

- **Project Exploration:**

  - This is the information from the [Project Exploration assignment](02-ProjectExploration.md). It will have been completed previously for projects that were explored, but will need to be created if a new project is being reviewed.

- **Project Review:**

  - **Developer Community Communication:** This section will explore how active and responsive the community is. It will give you an idea of what it would be like to try to ask questions or engage in discussion with the community.

    - **Channels:** Most projects will have several communication channels (e.g. IRC/Gitter/Slack/Discord/Mailing List/Forums/etc.), with each serving a different purpose for the community (team meetings, Q&A, knowledge base, live help, user forums, developer chat, community building, ect.).

    What are the main channels that developers use to communicate with each other in this project? Note that while the Issue Tracker is such a communication channel it is addressed separately, so should not be included here. Answer the following questions for each of the channels that the project uses.

      - **Name/Link:** What is the name of this communication channel? What platform is used for this channel? Give a link to the main page for this communication channel.

      - **Purpose:** Describe how the community uses this particular communication channel?

      - **Currency:** When was the most recent information added to this channel?

      - **Activity:** How active has this channel been recently? You might Estimate how many new messages are posted in the last day, week or month.  Briefly describe how you made your estimate.

      - **Responsiveness:** How likely are requests for information/help on this channel receive responses from the community? Categorize this as: very likely, probably, maybe, or never. Briefly describe why you chose the category that you did.

      - **Response Time:** When a response is received, on average how long does it take?

      - **Member:** Who are a few of the most communicative community members on this channel (nicknames or handles are fine)?

      - **Tone:** Describe the tone of the discussion on this channel? Is it welcoming, formal, informal, highly technical? Do you think you would be comfortable interacting with the community on this channel?

  - **Issue Tracking:** This section will explore how issues are reported/tracked/discussed by the community. It will give you an idea of what it will be like to work on bugs/features within the community.

    - **Name/Link:** What system is used to track bugs/feature requests? Give a link to the main page of the issue tracker.

    - **Volume:** How many open (non-closed) issues are there at this moment?

    - **Currency:** When were the most recent 5-10 issues opened? Note: Most issue trackers will allow you to sort by creation date. Estimate this as within a week, within a month, within 6 months, between 6 months and a year, or over a year ago.

    - **Activity:** When were the most recent 5-10 comments/edits/revisions of issues? Note: Most issue trackers will allow you to sort by the date of the last activity. Estimate this as within a week, within a month, within 6 months, between 6 months and a year, or over a year ago.

    - **Resolution:** When were the most recent 5-10 closed issues closed? Note: Most issue trackers will allow you to view closed issues and sort by the date they were closed. Estimate this as within a week, within a month, within 6 months, between 6 months and a year, or over a year ago.

  - **Getting Started:** This section will explore what resources are available to new developers looking to join the community. It will give you an idea of what it might be like if you decide to work on this project.  Be sure to look at the project's web site, its repositories and any other sources they provide.

    - **Documents:** Identify and give links to any documents relevant to newcomers (e.g. installation, getting started, how to contribute, newcomer threads in communication channels, etc.). Skim each one fairly quickly and give an assessment of it as very clear, clear, confusing, or useless.

    - **Organization:** How well organized is the project overall? Some questions to consider here include How easy was it to find information as a newcomer to the project? Is it easy to identify the information you might need? Is the amount of information helpful without being overwhelming? Is there out of date or redundant information that may be confusing?

    - **Communication:** Browse the communication channels and the issue tracker and find some messages/comments by newcomers  Have they received responses? Does the tone of communications seem welcoming to new developers? Why?

    - **Issues:** Most issue trackers allow issues to be tagged/labeled. What (if any) tags/labels does the project use to identify issues that would be good for new developers?  How many issues are tagged/labeled in this way? How recently were they posted? Have comments/questions on them received responses from the community? Are issues tagged in this way getting closed?

    - **User Installation:** Describe how the code or application distributed to users of the product? This may be distributed separately from the code. Give a link to the download site if one exists. Some projects also provide live demo sites that you can visit to try the application. Give links to any such demo sites.

    - **Developer Installation:** How do developers looking to contribute to the project get setup to contribute? Give a link to the repository or organization where the source code (e.g. on GitHub/GitLab/etc) can be obtained. Some projects will use multiple sites or migrate from site to site. Some projects will consist of a single repository, others will have multiple repositories within an organization.  Be sure you are considering the most current repository or organization for your project. Give links to any documents that describe how to setup a developer environment.

  - **Code Base:** This section will explore the code base in detail to get a better idea of how active the project is and how open it is to contributions from newcomers. Use information from the organization and repository(ies) to answer the following questions:
