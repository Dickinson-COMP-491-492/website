# WA04 - Ethical Reasoning Blog Post

The reading assignments thus far this semester have focused on ethical reasoning. In this assignment you will write a blog post analyzing a case study using a code of ethics or other framework for ethical reasoning. 

## Assignment

1. Find an ethical case study that is technology related, of interest to you, and distinct from the ones we have read about or discussed in class. Please contact the instructor if you have a question about whether a case study is appropriate.
2. Identify a framework that you will use to reason about the case study. You may use the SWE Code of Ethics or the Fair Information Practices we used in class. Alternatively, you may choose to use another reputable framework that is applicable to your chosen case. Please contact the instructor if you have a question about whether a framework is appropriate.
3. Write a blog post for a tech literate audience that reasons about the case study using the framework you have chosen, additional external resources, and your own _well-founded_ opinions.

### Requirements

The following requirements must be met, but are not sufficient to ensure a high quality post.  The post must:

- be of an appropriate length. You should target 1000 words (~2 single spaced pages). There will be some leeway for *slightly* longer posts if the writing is concise and compelling.
- be written in the style of the [Science + Tech section of The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/us/technology).
- draw support from multiple sources, including some not assigned for this course. These sources must be reputable and may include news articles, opinion pieces, other blogs, videos, formal academic sources, etc. They may include sources assigned in other courses.
  - When details are drawn from a source, a contextual link should be included within the text. See the posts in the [Science + Tech section of The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/us/technology) for examples.
- be grammatically correct.
- include embedded multimedia (e.g. images, audio, video, etc.) only as it is directly related to the topic and enhances the reader's experience. Any embedded content must be used in a way that is compliant with its copyright and/or license.
- be compliant with the [AI Use](../syllabus.md#ai-use) policy in the Syllabus.

In addition, you should consider explicitly licensing your content using a [Creative Commons License](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/) so that others know how they may and may not use your work.

### Quality Criteria

Affirmative answers to the following questions will be indicative of high quality posts.

- Will the post's title and opening capture the reader's attention and make them want to read more (without being [clickbaity](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/clickbaity))?
- Will your computer science peers, potential employers, future co-workers and reasonably tech literate internet strangers find post accessible, interesting and engaging?
- Will an engaged reader be able to follow your reasoning with an appropriate amount of effort?
