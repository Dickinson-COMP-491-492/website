To complete this assignment:
1. Review the [WA01-BlogPostDraft assignment](./WA01-BlogPostDraft.md) to be sure that it is fresh in your memory.
2. Download [The Peer Review Template](./materials/WA02-PeerReviewTemplate.docx) and familiarize yourself with the questions that it contains.  These are the questions you will be answering about each of the drafts that you read.
3. Find the `COMP491/PeerReviews` directory in your [Dickinson WiD Repository](https://github.com/Dickinson-COMP-WiD) on GitHub. This directory will contain draft blog posts from two of your classmates.
   - These files will have a name like `XX-SomeTitle-draft_Redacted.pdf` or `YY-AnotherTitle-draft_Redacted.pdf`, where `XX` and `YY` are numbers that the instructor is using to identify the drafts and your peer reviews.
4. For each of the drafts that you have been assigned:
   1. Make a copy of the template using a filename like `XX-SomeTitle-PeerReview.docx` or `YY-AnotherTitle-PeerReview.docx`, where `XX-SomeTitle` or `YY-AnotherTitle` match the blog post draft that you are reviewing.
   2. Read the draft keeping the questions in The Peer Review Template in mind.
   3. Respond to each question in the template with careful, kind, honest, and constructive feedback for your classmates. Keep in mind that the goal is to help them improve their draft when they revise it into a final submission.
