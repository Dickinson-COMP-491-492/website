## PP03 - Demo Day Presentation

This semester your teams have been working on contributions to your chosen project. In the Demo Day presentations you will give a technical demonstration of one of the contributions on which your team has been working.

### Assignment

1. As a team, identify contributions that the team has worked on and that have had enough work done on them to make an interesting demonstration.
2. Determine who will be demonstrating which contributions. Ideally demonstrations will occur in pairs, exceptions for individuals or trios may be granted by the instructor.
   - Note: This assignment is about presentation not technical accomplishments, so it is not required that the demonstration in which you participate be of work that you have done personally. You may partner with another member of your team.
3. Prepare and deliver a demonstration of a contribution that includes the [Content](#content), and meets the [Requirements](#requirements) and [Criteria](#criteria) as described below.

#### Content

The demonstration should strive to tell a cohesive, interesting and engaging story. In doing so it should include the following content:
- an explanation and demonstration of the bug/feature/etc that the contribution is aiming to address.
- an explanation and demonstration of the effect(s) of the contribution.
- a presentation of the contribution's code explaining how it implements the effect(s) that were shown.

#### Requirements

The following requirements must be met, but are not sufficient to ensure a high quality presentation (see [Criteria](#criteria) below).  The presentation must:
- be 9-10 minutes long.
- include an additional 3-4 minutes for question and answer.

  - Will the audience understand the effect that the contribution has had, including the degree to which it has or has not addressed the issue?
  - Will the audience clearly understand how the code implements the contribution being demonstrated?

- **Presentation Materials:** 
  - Do the presentation materials (slides, white board, video, etc) effectively serve the purpose of helping the audience understand the content?
    - Will the audience members be able to process visual content in real-time while also listening to what is being said?
    - Are all images and text clearly legible from the back of the room?

- **Presenter:** 
  - Does the presenter use verbal and/or visual cues and/or gestures to adequately guide the audience to relevant content?
  - Is the presenter convincing in their mastery of the material?
    - Does the presenter speak clearly, audibly, and fluidly without excessive reliance on reading from notes or slides?
    - Are the details presented technically correct?
