## Syllabus

### Course Description

The Senior Seminar (COMP491/492 combined) has two main components:

1. A year long project with two options:
   - H/FOSS Projects: Students will work in teams to select and engage with a Free and Open Source (FOSS) project or a Humanitarian FOSS (HFOSS) project and work towards meaningful contributions to their chosen project community.
   - Research Projects: Students may with approval pursue an independent research project under the supervision of a faculty member.  Research projects are most commonly completed by students pursuing departmental honors.
2. Readings, in-class exercises, class discussions and reflective writings related to:
   - Software engineering (concentrated in 491/fall).
   - Social, legal and ethical issues related to computing (concentrated in 492/spring).

### Course Schedule

### Learning Goals

Students will:
- improve their mastery in problem solving applicable to a wide variety of disciplines.
- become more prepared for graduate study in computing or to begin a professional career in computing.  
- participate in a year-long project that enhances their technical computing skill set in a way that is applicable, adaptable, and relevant to contemporary computing infrastructure, including large-scale projects and open source projects.  
- enhance their ability to work and collaborate in teams.  
- expand their understanding of social, legal and ethical issues raised by computing.  
- expand their perspectives on the value of computing, including: the role of computing in understanding the physical world, generating commercial value, advancing technology, and driving social change; and the transformational power of computing in service to the greater good.
- [WiD goal] enhance their ability to present technical information to an audience of computing professionals in both written and oral form.
- [WiD goal] develop their ability to write about and express an opinion on a social, legal or ethical issue in computing for a broad technical audience.
- [WiD goal] reflect on their experiences with the computer science major and the relationship of those experiences to their future goals and plans.

#### Attendance

The success of the Senior Seminar is in a large part up to you as its primary participants. Thus, attendance is required for every class period. Each *unexcused* absence will result in a 5% reduction of your final grade. Leaving the classroom with excessive frequency or for prolonged periods of time may also result in a grade reduction.

Up to two absences may be excused with **reasonable advance notice** and **a valid reason**. Valid reasons include illness, job interviews with documentation, religious holidays, and emergencies. As much advance notice as is possible should be given. Absences without reasonable advance notice will very rarely be excused regardless of reason.

If advance notice is received and the absence is excused you will be required to complete an additional assignment to makeup for the missed experience. The instructor will provide the exact assignment and its due date when an absence is excused.

#### Late Work

Managing your time, balancing priorities and accepting quality tradeoffs are important skills and dispositions. Thus, with the notable exceptions of excused absences, individual extensions will not be given and late work will not be accepted. 

In the event of other unavoidable events, the instructor will determine if due date adjustments are warranted and if so will grant them for the entire class.

### Academic Integrity

Please take the time to read the Academic Misconduct section of [Dickinson's Community Standards](https://www.dickinson.edu/download/downloads/id/11821/community_standards.pdf). Violations of this policy are considered serious transgressions, so you should be especially certain that you understand your rights and responsibilities under it. Students suspected of academic dishonesty will be subject to the process outlined in the [Student Conduct](http://www.dickinson.edu/homepage/69/student_conduct) pages. The specific collaboration policies for each component of this course are detailed in the assignments. If you are unsure about whether or not certain kinds of collaboration are permissible on an assignment or in this course, ask your instructor

### Intellectual Property Rights

Audio or video recording of class meetings, lectures or discussions is prohibited without explicit permission of the instructor. Photographic records of whiteboards, projected slides or other visual media is also prohibited without explicit permission of the instructor. In any case where permission is given for audio/video/photographic records to be made they are for personal use only. They may not be shared or redistributed and must be destroyed at the end of their usefulness or within one week following the termination of this course, whichever comes first. Similarly, any redistribution of sample code, homework solution sets or provided lab code is prohibited. Please note that all outside materials used in the course (readings/tutorials/assignments/projects/etc) are also be governed by their own licensing agreements.

### Accommodations Students with Disabilities

Dickinson values diverse types of learners and is committed to ensuring that each student is afforded equitable access to participate in all learning experiences. If you have (or think you may have) a learning difference or a disability – including a mental health, medical, or physical condition – that would hinder your access to learning or demonstrating knowledge in this class, please contact Access and Disability Services (ADS). They will confidentially explain the accommodation request process and the type of documentation needed to determine your eligibility for reasonable accommodations. To learn more about available supports, go to [www.dickinson.edu/ADS](https://www.dickinson.edu/ADS), email access@dickinson.edu, call (717)245-1734, or go to the ADS office in Room 005 of Old West, Lower Level (aka "the OWLL").

If you’ve already been granted accommodations at Dickinson, please follow the guidance at [www.dickinson.edu/AccessPlan](https://www.dickinson.edu/AccessPlan) for disclosing the accommodations for which you are eligible and scheduling a meeting with me as soon as possible so that we can discuss your accommodations and finalize your Access Plan. If you will be using any test-taking accommodations in this class, be sure to enter all test dates into your Access Plan in advance of our meeting. ADS will be happy to provide any assistance you may need.

### Accessibility

The room in which this class meets and my office are both located on the second floor of Tome Hall. Tome Hall has an elevator that is located to the left of the stairs inside the main building entrance. If you require the use of an elevator to access our class or my office and are unable to locate it, please let me know. If there is ever a malfunction with the elevator, we will be notified by email, and I will consult with ADS to identify our options for that day.

### Life Happens:

Sometimes stuff just happens. Sometimes it is an unexpected sudden event such as an illness or family emergency. Other times it may be an ongoing issue or concern or an accumulation of smaller issues. Any of these things may affect your (or my) ability to focus or perform up to your (or my) potential through no shortcoming or fault of your (my) own. 

Dickinson is a kind and caring community and we want to see you achieve at your full potential. So, if you are experiencing life events that are affecting your performance please don’t hesitate to talk to your instructor, your advisor or your class Dean. They will all be willing to talk with you, help to formulate a plan and/or connect you with others that may be able to assist.
