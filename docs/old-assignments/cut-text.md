##### Live-Logs

You will use *Slack Live-Logs* to document the time and effort that you invest in learning and to keep a record of what you have learned.  

A Slack Live-Log is a thread in your team's Slack channel that is associated with a task. When you, or a partner or a sub-set of your team begin a new task, a new thread should be created to Live-Log the work on that task. As work happen on a task, whomever is working on it will post messages to the thread associated with the task (i.e. they will *Live-Log* their work on the task.)

Live-Log messages should occur frequently and should document all significant events during your work:
- What resource you are using, with a link.
- When you start a new section of a resource.
- Useful facts or examples from the resource.
- Anything you might not remember but think will be useful to know later.
- Anything that you find confusing or challenges that you face.
- An explanation of something that you didn't understanding the first time.
- A description of how of you got something to work that was giving you issues.
- Finishing a section of a resource.
- Links to any additional sources you found useful while working, with links.

Your Live-Logs will serve several purposes:
- They will become a set of notes and resources that you can refer back to more quickly and easily than the original resources.  (Oh... What was that thing I did? Or that site I used? - Easy! Search Slack and check the Live-Log.)
- They will document the time and effort that you have invested in this assignment. The Live-Logs are your mechanism for demonstrating that you have invested sufficient, regular and sustained time and effort on this activity.  Deficient, infrequent or absent Live-Logs will be interpreted as reflecting a failure to invest appropriate time and effort on this activity.

### Presentation

Each team will give a presentation that:
 - Briefly summarizes the Gap Analysis focusing on who set out to learn what and why they were learning it.
 - For each gap:
   - Identifies key learning resources that were used.
   - Explains what was learned.
   - Gives a demonstration of what was learned/built.
   - Articulates what remains to be learned.

Prepare this presentation for an audience of your peers (advanced undergraduate computer science majors). You may assume that they know a good bit about computer science and free and open source software. However, you should not assume that they know anything about the specific project your team is working on or the technologies you have learned about in this activity. When discussing topics that are outside of the audience's assumed knowledge, context and background sufficient for the audience to follow the presentation should be provided.

The grading rubric for PAE is given below.  More specific grading rubrics for each assignment will be given in the assignment document linked on the course schedule.

#### Participation/Attendance/Engagement (PAE)

The success of the Senior Seminar is in a large part up to you as its primary participants. My hope is that you will all engage in the material, prepare carefully and come to our meetings excited to participate in discussions and activities with your peers. If that happens then our meetings will be lively and interesting and we will be able to focus largely on the aspects of the material that are most interesting to you as a group. Plus, its good practice - many employers are now using [Group Discussions as a screening technique before or during interviews!](https://www.reed.co.uk/career-advice/group-interview-tips-dos-and-donts/)

##### On Discussion Days

On days that we are discussing topics, you are expected to complete readings before class, think about and process them.  In addition, you are expected to find, read and process at least one additional source on the topic of the day. You will then make a post to the discussion forum on the course Moodle.  The [Readings](assignments/readings.md) gives the assigned readings for each day and the details on what must be included in the Moodle post. You are then expected to actively participate in the class discussion of the topic. I will organize our discussions around the Moodle posts that you make. So the more thought you put into your Mood'e posts the more the discussion will be focused around things that are of interest to the class.

If you find participating in class discussions challenging, please feel free to talk with me about strategies that may help.  In addition, these sites have some good advice on increasing or improving class participation:
- [Ways to Improve Your Class Participation Experience](https://studylib.net/doc/18188459/ways-to-improve-your-class-participation-experience--sugg...): A short list of suggestions from Students from the Bureau of Study Counsel in the Center for Academic and Personal Development at Harvard University.
- [Class Participation: More Than Just Raising Your Hand](https://www.millersville.edu/gened/files/pdfs-faculty-handbook/class-participation-tutorial.pdf): A longer tutorial that may help you assess strengths and weaknesses and formulate a plan for improving your class participation.

##### On Work Days

On days that are designated "Work Day" you will have time to work on assignments. Early on, this will be individual work, but later it will be time to work collectively with your project team. On these days it is expected that you (and your team) will have done work prior to the class and will arrive in class with a plan for how to make productive use of the time. In addition, I will circulate among the project teams to check on the status of your work and to help address challenges being faced.

##### PAE rubric

PAE will be evaluated daily using the criteria in the following rubric.

### Course Components

#### Participation/Attendance/Engagement (PAE)

The success of the Senior Seminar is in a large part up to you as its primary participants. Our hope is that you will all engage in the material, prepare carefully and come to our meetings excited to participate in discussions and activities with your peers. If that happens then our meetings will be lively and interesting and we will be able to focus largely on the aspects of the material that are most interesting to you as a group. Plus, its good practice - many employers are now using [Group Discussions as a screening technique before or during interviews!](https://www.reed.co.uk/career-advice/group-interview-tips-dos-and-donts/)

PAE is assessed for each individual during each class period. Preparation includes completion of any reading, tutorials, exercises or activities assigned. Attendance is your presence in class during our scheduled meetings. Engagement combines participation in discussion and activities with with a demonstrated investment both in the material and the betterment of the class for everyone.
- **NOTE: 2021-22** - While attendance is very important in this class, protecting our community is more important.  If you are feeling ill, please get in touch with your instructor, follow campus protocols and do not attend class. Alternative methods for participation and engagement will be provided.  Absences for illness will not affect this score.

PAE scores will be assigned according to the rubric below. The standard score in each category, and what you should generally expect to receive, is a ✓. Something exceptionally notable is required to move either up to a ✓+ or down to 0 or ✓-.  Rarely a ✓++ score may be given to recognize truly outstanding performance in a rubric category.

#### Blog / Reflective Writing:

An important part of learning about and understanding issues is to reflect upon them after reading and discussion. This gives you a chance to process the information, organize your thoughts, incorporate insights from others. To facilitate this, you will write reflective blog posts following class discussions related to social/legal/ethical issues in computing. You are given wide latitude in these posts to reflect/expand on some aspect of the reading/discussion topic that was of interest to you. Doing so on a public-facing blog encourages careful thought, precise writing and can provide evidence of your knowledge and abilities to prospective employers and/or graduate programs.

The best posts will:
- be approximately 500 words.
- be closely related to the reading/discussion.
- be clear, focused and grammatically correct.
- be written to be of interest to an audience beyond our course.
- go beyond a mere summary of the reading/discussion.
- include multimedia (images, audio, video, etc.) only as appropriate to enhance the content of the post. Be sure that if you use any external content that you are using it in a way that is allowed by its license.

Blog posts will be assessed using the rubric below. The standard score, and what you should generally expect to receive, is a ✓. Something exceptionally notable is required to move either up to a ✓+ or down to 0 or ✓-. Rarely a ✓++ score may be given to recognize truly outstanding performance in a rubric category.

If you find writing blog posts challenging, some good advice on writing effective blog entries can be found at:
- [Effective Academic Blogging](http://writing2.richmond.edu/writing/wweb/blogging.html) from the Writer's Web at the University of Richmond Writing Center.
- [Blogs](http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/blogs/) from The Writing Center at UNC-Chapel Hill.
- [Writing a Blog](Writing a Blog) workshop video from the Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) Writing Center.
- There is no shortage of other advice, just google "How to write a blog" and find something that resonates with you and matches the goals of the course.

#### Tutorials / Homework Exercises

Early in the semester there will be a number of tutorials and homework assignments designed to introduce you to some of the tools and techniques commonly used in FOSS projects (and in professional software development as well). Typically these assignments will require you to complete some tutorials and activities while keeping a Slack Live-Log (see below) of your work

Tutorials and homework exercises will be assessed largely on completion and effort as documented by the associated Slack live-logs according to the rubric below. The standard score, and what you should generally expect to receive, is a ✓. Something exceptionally notable is required to move either up to a ✓+ or down to 0 or ✓-. Rarely a ✓++ score may be given to recognize live-logs that demonstrate truly outstanding learning beyond expectations.

_Click rubric to enlarge image._<br>
[![Homework Rubric](images/homework.jpg)](images/homework.jpg)

#### Project/Community Selection or Research Proposal

Students pursuing H/FOSS projects will be assigned several preliminary exercises leading to the selection of an H/FOSS project/community. Each project group will then give a presentation on their selected project/community. Project/community selection will be assessed based on the completion and quality of the preliminary exercises and the presentation according to rubric below. The standard score, and what you should generally expect to receive, is a ✓. Something exceptionally notable is required to move either up to a ✓+ or down to 0 or ✓-. performance in a rubric category. Rarely a ✓++ score may be given to recognize truly outstanding performance in a rubric category. Additional assignment details will be posted on the course schedule.

_Click rubric to enlarge image._<br>
[![Project Selection Rubric](images/projsel.jpg)](images/projsel.jpg)

Students pursuing Departmental Honors will turn in a copy of their Research Proposal and give a presentation of their proposed research. Students pursuing Honors will also complete a reduced version of the Project/Community Selection exercises to provide an appropriate introduction to H/FOSS projects and communities. The Research Proposal will be assessed, with input from the Honors Advisors, based on the quality of the written proposal and presentation. The proposal and the Project/Community selection exercises will be assessed according to rubric below. The standard score, and what you should generally expect to receive, is a ✓. Something exceptionally notable is required to move either up to a ✓+ or down to 0 or ✓-. Rarely a ✓++ score may be given to recognize truly outstanding performance in a rubric category.

_Click rubric to enlarge image._<br>
[![Research Proposal Rubric](images/researchprop.jpg)](images/researchprop.jpg)

#### Project Checkpoints

At each Project Checkpoint the work on the project since the last checkpoint will be assessed. The assessment will include the following elements:
- Slack Live-Logs (H/FOSS projects only / see below)
- Individual 5-15 (H/FOSS projects only / see below)
- Instructor's assessment of individual effectiveness (H/FOSS projects only)
- Team 5-15 or Honors 5-15 (see below)
- Project Checkpoint Presentation. This presentation should briefly reintroduce the project and then address: what has been accomplished since the prior checkpoint, what challenges have been overcome and how, what has been learned, what impediments are being faced currently and how they will be overcome. These presentations should also include live demonstrations that highlight accomplishments. The presentation should conclude with reflection on what has been learned in a broad context and what can be improved on going forward. Note that the presentation does not need to cover every detail in depth. Rather it should go into depth on some of the more interesting aspects and can just list the other aspects. Overall, it is important that the presentation tell a cohesive, interesting, understandable story about the work to the target audience.
- Instructor's assessment of the individual's effectiveness in advancing the team's project work. For honor's projects the thesis advisor will be consulted in making this assessment.

Project Checkpoints will be scored using the rubric below. The standard score, and what you should generally expect to receive, is a ✓. Something exceptionally notable is required to move either up to a ✓+ or down to 0 or ✓-. Rarely a ✓++ score may be given to recognize truly outstanding performance in a rubric category.

<!--
#### Leading a Discussion
Class readings and discussions during the spring semester will focus on contemporary social, legal and ethical issues in computing. The professor will establish the basis for these discussions during the first several weeks of the course through readings and discussions of ethical frameworks and case studies of their application. Students, in small groups, will select the topics, identify readings and prepare and lead a class discussion.

Work for this assignment will consist of three main components:
1. **Topic Selection:** Topics will be identified and selected; groups and dates for discussion will be assigned during the first week of class. In addition, it is highly recommended that each group visit with the professor to discuss their topic and their approach to it. The professor will be able to help shape and focus the topic and may be able to suggest resources and possible readings for your topic.
2. **Preparation:** In preparation for leading your discussion the following elements are required:
   1. _Readings:_ Identify reading(s) for the class to complete before the discussion. The reading(s) should provide both an academic overview of the topic area and a current discussion, example or case study. You may find it helpful to use both library and on-line searches to find the most appropriate materials. You are expected to read much more about your topic than you assign to the class. This is to better inform you about the topic and to ensure that you are well informed on it as you begin to prepare to lead the discussion. The list of readings that you plan to assign is _due to the professor two weeks prior to your discussion date._ You are highly encouraged to discuss your reading lists with the professor prior to the submitting the final list.
   2. _Questions:_ Develop a list of 3-5 questions for class discussion. These questions should be designed to address the important issues, facilitate the examination of the issue from different perspectives and lead to engaging conversation during class. Your list of questions is due to the professor _one week prior to your discussion date._ You are highly encouraged to discuss your questions with the professor prior to the submitting the final list.
   3. _Plan the Discussion:_ The group must decide how to run the discussion (see Leading a Discussion below) and identify the key points to be sure are raised in the discussion. Your plan should include the questions you posed, trying to anticipate different views and thinking about how to respectfully challenge the views that arise.
   4. _Written Responses:_ Each member of the discussion group must submit an individually written response (~1 paragraph each) for each of the questions that have been posed. These responses are to be submitted to Moodle by 8am on the day of the discussion.
   5. _Review Moodle Forum Posts:_ Before leading the discussion the group members must review the forum posts made by the rest of the class. You are not expected to change your plan for the discussion based on these posts. Rather, having read them you will know better what to expect during the discussion. This will enable you to ask effective follow-on questions or to draw out interesting perspectives that have been expressed by your classmates by asking them to contribute.
3. **Leading Class Discussion:** Lead the class discussion in a well organized, thoughtful and effective manner. This will include exercising appropriate control over the discussion, ensuring all voices are heard and respected, making sure that the most significant points are addressed and moving through the topics at a reasonable pace.

Class discussions will be scored using the rubric below. The standard score, and what you should generally expect to receive, is a ✓. Something exceptionally notable is required to move either up to a ✓+ or down to 0 or ✓-. Rarely a ✓++ score may be given to recognize truly outstanding performance in a rubric category.

_Click rubric to enlarge image._<br>
[![Class Discussion Rubric](images/discussion.jpg)](images/discussion.jpg)
<br>_Note: Some language adapted from John MacCormick's earlier offering of this course._

You can be creative in how you organize and run the discussion. You might model your class on what you have experienced in other courses or other settings. The following sites also give some good advice on leading discussions:
  - [The Big List of Class Discussion Strategies](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/speaking-listening-techniques/) on Jennifer Gonzalez's Cult of Pedagogy blog.
  - [13 Strategies to Improve Student Classroom Discussion](https://www.weareteachers.com/13-strategies-to-improve-student-classroom-discussions/) from the WeAreTeachers Site.
  - [Discussion Strategies](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/discussion-strategies/) from The Teaching Center.

#### Poster Presentation
Posters have become a common mechanism for presenting project results at professional meetings and conferences. This assignment provides experience developing a poster and presenting your work in a less formal small group or one-on-one setting. Students will present their poster at the Science Research Symposium or the [Civic Engagement Symposium](https://www.dickinson.edu/info/20378/civic_engagement/4213/civic_engagement_symposium). The course faculty will work with teams to determine the appropriate venue.

##### Poster Content and Audience

- Science symposium posters should emphasize the research question being addressed, the methods used and the results obtained.
- Civic Engagement Symposium posters should emphasize the need addressed by the application, the user and developer communities, interactions with those communities, the interactions and contributions that you have made and what you have learned from the experience.  More details on the expectations for this type of poster are available on the [Civic Engagement Symposium](https://www.dickinson.edu/info/20378/civic_engagement/4213/civic_engagement_symposium) site.
- The target audience for the posters should be other students and faculty who are unfamiliar with your project and also are not studying computer science. Note: This does not imply that you should not include any code, but you'll need to plan and contextualize carefully to make your points to this audience!
- Consider whether having a live demo as part of your presentation makes sense. If so, use a laptop beside the poster for the demo.

##### Poster Creation
- Posters should be a maximum of 36"h x 44"w.
- Posters titles should be legible from 20 feet. Other content should be clearly legible from 4-6 feet.
- Creating your poster as a single large PowerPoint slide is a relatively easy approach. Search for [PowerPoint Poster Templates](https://www.google.com/search?q=powerpoint+poster+templates&oq=power+point+poster+tem&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.7495j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) to find lots of predefined templates you can adapt to your needs. Or, express your own style by setting the slide size in PowerPoint to the size of the poster you want and laying everything out yourself!
- Use the posters hanging around the department as examples. Read a few of them and emulate the ones you feel do a good job. In addition, there are a number of good sites that give advice on producing poster for presentations:
   - [Ten Simple Rules for a Good Poster Presentation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1876493/) from PLos Computational Biology, May 2007.
   - [Make a Good Poster](https://undergrad.stanford.edu/opportunities/research/go-further/surpsasurps/make-good-poster) - Video and tips from the Undergrad Research and Independent Projects site at Stanford.
   - [Poster Presentation Information](https://in.nau.edu/undergraduate-research/poster-presentation-information/) from the Division of Undergraduate Research at Northern Arizona University.
   - [Effective Poster Presentations](https://cirt.gcu.edu/research/developmentresources/tutorials/posterpresent) from the Center for Innovation and Research in Teaching at Grand Canyon University. The embedded videos are helpful!

Posters will be scored using the rubric below. The standard score, and what you should generally expect to receive, is a ✓. Something exceptionally notable is required to move either up to a ✓+ or down to 0 or ✓-. Rarely a ✓++ score may be given to recognize truly outstanding performance in a rubric category.

### Time & Effort Documentation Tools

#### Slack Live-Logs

All students will be required to keep Slack Live-Logs for the early homework assignments, as described above. In addition, FOSS Project teams will be required to maintain Slack Live-Logs for their project work throughout the remainder of the semester.

A Slack Live-Log is just a series of messages posted to a Slack channel as you work. The messages should paint a rough picture of what you are doing, when you did it and any other interesting/useful tidbits to be remembered while you are working. Ideally, when working in a pair, one partner will be controlling the machine where the project work is happening and the other will be live-logging on another machine. These roles should be swapped regularly. It is not necessary to document every tiny thing, and you don't have to use polished language, grammar and punctuation. You can see a sample live-log in the sample-live-log channel in the COMP491 Slack team.

For homework assignments the Slack Live-Log will be used to demonstrate that you have worked through the appropriate exercises, tutorials and assignments.

For FOSS Project work the Slack Live-Log will be used to demonstrate an appropriate investment of time and quality effort in the project work, as well as to document your progress through the project guides. Each of you has different experience and every FOSS project has different technical challenges. Thus, some tasks will be easier (or harder) than others and what is accomplished will vary between teams, from week-to-week and between projects. Thus, rather than relying solely on final products for credit teams will be expected to invest an appropriate amount of time and effort on their project work each week. Slack Live-Logs provide the mechanism for documenting the time and effort invested in the project.

In addition to keeping a record of what a team has done and how long it has worked, these live-logs are intended to encourage teams to practice and demonstrate that they are working via steady, sustained engagement rather than in long irregular bursts. Working via steady, sustained engagement is more effective, more productive and less frustrating than working in long irregular bursts. It allows time to process information, generate new ideas, communicate with faculty, peers and the project's development community.

#### Five-Fifteen
A [five-fifteen report](https://www.contractingbusiness.com/archive/article/20864629/the-fivefifteen-report) is a short weekly templated report that is designed to enhance communication, reflection, prioritization, goal setting and time management without being time consuming. The name five-fifteen reflects that the report should take no more than five minutes to read and no more than fifteen minutes to write.

We will use three types of 5-15 reports to reflect on your accomplishments, your self and your team, and to identify and plan future work. H/FOSS project students will complete Individual 5-15s and Team 5-15s. Honor's student's will complete a 5-15 tailored for individual research projects.

All 5-15's will be maintained as a Wiki page with the most recent entry at the top. Individual 5-15's will be linked with your personal information on the course Wiki (i.e. on the page with your blog and git links). Team and Honor's 5-15's will be linked from the project Wiki page.

Successive 5-15s should relate back to prior 5-15s to make clear how things that were planned turned into accomplishments, how thoughts on how to improve team function were enacted, how challenges/roadblocks were overcome, etc.

##### Individual 5-15

Each individual 5-15 must have the headings given below and each must be followed by a few sentences or an annotated list.

1. Period Ending (mm/dd/yyyy)
2. What did my team accomplish?
3. How did I contribute to those accomplishments?
4. What did I learn / How did I improve?
5. How can I improve?

##### Team 5-15

Each Team 5-15 must have the headings given below and each must be followed by a few sentences or an annotated list.

1. Period Ending (mm/dd/yyyy)
2. What were the team's accomplishments?
3. What Interactions did the team have with the community? Include links to any interactions that are publicly accessible (e.g. posting to list serve, comment on an issue, etc.)
5. What Contributions did the team make to the community? Include links to any publicly accessible contributions (e.g. documents, pages, new/refined/edited/closed tickets, pull requests, etc.)
6. How is the team functioning? How can it be improved?
7. What technical challenges/roadblocks does the team face?
8. What's next?
9. What steps will the team take to accomplish that? Who? When?

##### Honors 5-15

Each Project 5-15 must have the headings given below and each must be followed by a few sentences or an annotated list.

1. Period Ending (mm/dd/yyyy)
2. What did I accomplish?
3. What did I learn?
