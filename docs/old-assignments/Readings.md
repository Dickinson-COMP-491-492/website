# Readings and Discussions

This page will provide the readings for all of the class discussions.  Readings for topics will be added as the discussion days approach.  Be sure that you are completing the readings for the correct topic and date.

Our readings on Software Engineering topics will be drawn from the book [Cooperative Software Development](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/) by [Amy J. Ko](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/). Additional readings on other topics will be drawn from a variety of sources.

## Preparation:

On days that we are discussing topics, you are expected to complete readings before class, think about and process them.  In addition, you are expected to find and complete at least one additional reading on a topic in the above readings or on a question of your own related to today's topic that you would like to learn more about.

**By 8:00am on the class day** you are expected to make a posting to the discussion forum on the course Moodle site  Your posting must include the following headings and content:
- **Thoughts** - Give's a few sentences of your own thoughts on the topic. Don't simply summarize the readings. Give your thoughts on the topic but ensure that they are clearly connected to the content in the assigned reading(s).
- **Source** - Cite the additional source that you read on the topic (with a link or a full citation) and summarize in a few sentences how it expanded or changed your understanding of the topic.
- **Question(s)** - Post at least one question or discussion topic you would like us to consider as a class and include a sentence about why you think it would be a good question or topic to discuss as a class.
- Optionally, but encouraged, respond to your classmates posts, adding your thoughts or perspectives and/or seconding their questions/discussion topics.
