### Discussion Questions

Post to Moodle a response to _at least one_ of the following questions.  You are encouraged to also read and respond to your classmates postings, and to make additional posts adding your own thoughts or raising your own questions for discussion.  Your posts will help shape the discussion that we have during the class period.

1. The Vox Article said: But I think the primary appeal of Web3 comes from the fact that it really doesn’t exist yet. So in its yet-to-arrive shape, it could be anything. And that sounds great to people longing for something new, whether they’re young techies who’ve only known a world where a handful of giant tech companies dominate the internet, or wizened folks who remember the initial excitement and possibilities of the early web days. As a student in tech, are you optimistic or pessimistic about the Web3 hype?

2. With web3 being a decentralized concept, do you think that it'll be "re-centralized" with the majority of services offered by a few big companies, or will it be more spread out along different companies with a less-centralized basis?
