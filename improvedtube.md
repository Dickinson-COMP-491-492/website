## Product
ImprovedTube is a browser extension that enhances the YouTube experience by adding customization options and features not provided by the official site. Examples include changing playback speed defaults, customizing the layout, controlling autoplay, filtering recommendations, and applying themes. It allows users to fine-tune their YouTube usage for greater control and efficiency.

## Target User Community
The main user community is everyday YouTube users who want more control over their video-watching experience. The software addresses the need for customization and distraction management on YouTube. By providing an open-source browser extension, it allows users to take control of features that the default platform lacks.

## Activity
The repository shows steady contributions, with issues and pull requests still being addressed in 2025. Currently, there seems to be around weekly commits, certainly showing that the project is still alive. The activity is slow, but still just enough to show that there is a committed community for the project.

## Getting Started
The repository includes installation instructions and a [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/code-charity/youtube/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Since it is a browser extension, the development environment is lightweight, only requiring a web browser, text editor, and basic JavaScript/TypeScript knowledge. Documentation is brief but clear.

## Welcoming to Newcomers
The project uses GitHub issues actively and has tags like “good first issue.” The tone in discussions is generally positive, with contributors offering help to newcomers. The lightweight setup and modular design make it easier for new contributors to get involved quickly.

## Personal Interest
I selected ImprovedTube because unsurprisingly, I watch a lot of youtube. The current YouTube experience seems tailored to the advertisers rather than the users, and often instead of real, engaging content, I am met with junk that is made to cater to the algorithm. I could spend more time on YouTube watching content that enriches me instead of just wasting my time.
