## Product
Godot Engine is a fully open-source game engine for developing both 2D and 3D games. It features its own scripting language (GDScript), visual scripting tools, a scene-based architecture, and support for C#, C++, and other languages. Developers can use it to build games for desktop, web, and mobile platforms without licensing fees.

## Target User Community
Godot’s target community includes indie game developers, hobbyists, gamers, and new game developers who need a free, flexible alternative to commercial engines like Unity or Unreal. It meets their needs by providing a lightweight, modular tool that is easy to learn, customizable, and free of royalties — making it especially appealing for students and open-source developers.

## Activity
The Godot repository is extremely active, with thousands of contributors and near-daily commits. The project regularly merges pull requests and has a large issue tracker with continuous triage. Recent major releases show an clear and expanding roadmap, and the project is widely discussed across GitHub, community forums, and Discord.

## Getting Started
Godot has a very accessible [documentation portal](https://docs.godotengine.org/) and a detailed [contribution guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/index.html). New developers can easily download the engine binaries or build from source. Setup requires standard C++ build tools (SCons, Python, etc.). The documentation is comprehensive and extensive.

## Welcoming to Newcomers
Godot provides a “Contributing” section with guidance for first-timers and uses GitHub labels such as “good first issue” to onboard contributors. The tone in issue discussions is generally constructive, and the community hosts active Q&A spaces in Discord and forums. This indicates a welcoming environment, though the technical bar for code contributions is relatively high.

## Personal Interest
I selected Godot because I am someone who has always loved gaming and game development. I remembered hearing about Godot when it first came out, the idea was very appealing, but at the time it was not refined enough to have many people consider using it over Unity or Unreal. From what I have seen, it has vastly improved and become a game engine that developers should definitely consider.

## Skills Match
Godot’s core is written in **C++**, while scripting primarily uses **GDScript** (similar to Python). There is also support for **C#** and some Python tooling. I am more comfortable with Python, so learning GDScript would be manageable, but C++ contributions may require significant studying on my end. Documentation or scripting contributions would be the best fit for my current skill set.
